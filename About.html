    <p> <!---small bio about Lesedii--->
        Lesedii opened the store because she noticed that people were still very much afraid of owls because they have lived their lives believing that owls symbolize death.
        From ancient times on, owls have been linked with death, evil, and superstitions. Many cultures saw owls as a sign of impending death.
        So the goal is to show the population that owls are just as cute and fuzzy like dogs. :-)
